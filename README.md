## Usage

To start using the Mixcloud Desktop App, you have two options:

### 1. Download the Pre-compiled Version (Windows)

If you're using Windows, you can download the pre-compiled version of the Mixcloud Desktop App in a zip format from the following [link](https://www.dropbox.com/s/3pnavstdjpwet87/mixcloud-win32-x64.zip?dl=0). Extract it to your desired location. Once extracted, simply run the `mixcloud.exe` file to launch the application.

### 2. Build and Run the Application (All Platforms)

If you prefer to build and run the application yourself, follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine or download the source code as a ZIP file and extract it to a desired location.

2. Open your command-line interface and navigate to the project directory (`mixcloud` folder).

3. Install the project dependencies by running the following command:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
4. Run the following command to start the application:

   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

The Mixcloud Desktop App window will open, providing access to Mixcloud's content and features.


### 3. Packaging the Application  
If you wish to distribute your Mixcloud desktop app, Electron Packager can help you package it. Install Electron Packager as a development dependency by running:

    ```bash
    npm install electron-packager --save-dev
    ```

Next, update the "scripts" section in package.json as follows:

    ```json
    "scripts": {
    "start": "electron .",
    "package": "electron-packager . --platform=<platform> --arch=<arch> --out=dist --overwrite"
    }
    ```

Replace <platform> with your target platform (e.g., win32, darwin, or linux), and <arch> with the target architecture (e.g., x64 or arm64). You can specify multiple platforms and architectures separated by commas if needed.

To package the application, run the following command:

    ```bash
    npm run package
    ```

The packaged application files will be placed in the dist directory.

Choose the option that works best for you and start enjoying your favorite music mixes, radio shows, and podcasts directly from your desktop using the Mixcloud Desktop App!
